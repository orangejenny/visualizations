# NATSAL - breakups

This explores reasons that romantic relationships end, comparing monogamous and non-monogamous participants.
Data comes from [NATSAL](https://www.natsal.ac.uk).

Participants are classified as monogamous or non-monogamous based on their *ideal* relationship style.
These visualizations show the reason(s) given for their most recent breakup.

Since multiple reasons could be given for a breakup, each reason was also assigned a score, where the first reason named was scored the most important, the second reason slightly less improtant, and so forth.
